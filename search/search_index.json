To pass flags to the binary, wrap in quotes, or use --args instead. Example: gdbgui ./mybinary [other- gdbgui-args...] Example: gdbgui './mybinary myarg -flag1 -flag2' [other gdbgui args...] optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --args ... Specify the executable file and any arguments to pass to it. All arguments are taken literally, so if used, this must be the last argument passed to gdbgui. Example: gdbgui [...] --args ./mybinary myarg -flag1 -flag2 gdb settings: -g GDB, --gdb GDB Path to debugger. Default: gdb --gdb-args GDB_ARGS Arguments passed directly to gdb when gdb is invoked. For example,--gdb-args=\"--nx --tty=/dev/ttys002\" --rr Use `rr replay` instead of gdb. Replays last recording by default. Replay arbitrary recording by passing recorded directory as an argument. i.e. gdbgui /recorded/dir --rr. See http://rr-project.org/. gdbgui network settings: -p PORT, --port PORT The port on which gdbgui will be hosted. Default: 5000 --host HOST The host ip address on which gdbgui serve. Default: 127.0.0.1 -r, --remote Shortcut to set host to 0.0.0.0 and suppress browser from opening. This allows remote access to gdbgui and is useful when running on a remote machine that you want to view/debug from your local browser, or let someone else debug your application remotely. security settings: --auth-file AUTH_FILE Require authentication before accessing gdbgui in the browser. Specify a file that contains the HTTP Basic auth username and password separate by newline. --user USER Username when authenticating --password PASSWORD Password when authenticating --key KEY SSL private key.

If your change is small, go ahead and submit a pull request. If it is substantial, create a GitHub issue to discuss it before making the change. Development Instructions gdbgui uses https://github.com/theacodes/nox for to automate various tasks. You will need it installed on your system before continuing. Step 1: Install Python Dependencies git clone https://github.com/cs01/gdbgui cd gdbgui nox -s develop-3.7 # replace with desired Python version source nox/develop-3.7/bin/activate # replace with desired Python version You are now in a virtual environment with gdbgui's dependencies installed. When finished, type deactivate to leave the virtual environment. Step 2: Compile JavaScript Code gdbgui compiles JavaScript source code into a single .js file. Note that yarn can be replaced with npm : yarn install yarn start Now every JavaScript source file you change will trigger a recompilation. Step 3: Run Python server python -m gdbgui --debug The --debug flag: Automatically reloads the server when it detects changes you've made Adds a new component at the bottom of the right sidebar called \"gdb machine interface output\" that displays the raw gdb mi output to help you debug. Displays all changes to state data in the browser's developer console, such as rendered_source_file_fullname null -> /home/chad/git/gdbgui/examples/hello.c Step 4: Make your changes Open the browser to view gdbgui. Refresh the page as you make changes to JavaScript code. Note Make sure you have caching turned off in your browser. In Chrome, for example, this is a setting in the developer console. Step 5: Run and Add tests To continue, you must have nox installed. nox runs gdbgui unit tests. If you have changed any Python code, add new tests to gdbgui/tests/test_app.py as necessary. JavaScript tests are minimal, so you will have to manually excercise any code paths that may be affected. Documentation Modifying Documentation Documentation is made with mkdocs .

These guides help you get gdb and gdbgui working in specific environments. Remember, these guides, like gdbgui, are open source and can be edited by you, the users! See contributing to modify these docs. Running Locally After downloading gdbgui, you can launch it like so: gdbgui (or whatever the binary name is, i.e. gdbgui_0.10.0.0 ) gdbgui \"./mybinary -myarg value -flag1 -flag2\" (note the quotes around the arguments) gdbgui --args \"./mybinary -myarg value -flag1 -flag2\" (note the quotes around the arguments) A new tab in your browser will open with gdbgui in it. If a browser tab did not open, navigate to the ip/port that gdbgui is being served on (i.e. http://localhost:5000). Now that gdbgui is open, you can interactively run a program with it. * Type the path to the executable in the input at the top (next to \"Load Binary\"). The executable should already exist and have been compiled with the -g flag. * Click Load Binary . The program and symbols will load, but will not begin running. A breakpoint will be added to main automatically. This can be changed in settings if you prefer not to do this. * The line of source code corresponding to main will display if the program was compiled with the -g flag debug symbols. * Click the Run button, which is on the top right and looks like a circular arrow. * Step through the program by clicking the Next, Step, Continue, icons as desired. These are also on the top right. For a list of gdbgui arguments, run gdbgui --help . Running Remotely Because gdbgui is a server, it naturally allows you to debug programs running on other computers. ssh into the computer with the program that needs to be debugged. run gdbgui -r on the remote machine (this will serve publicly so beware of security here) on your local machine, open your browser and access the remote machine's ip and port debug the remote computer in your local browser Note that gnu also distrubutes a program called gdbserver which gdbgui is compatible with. See the relevant section in this doc. Debugging Rust Programs gdbgui can be used to debug programs written in Rust. Assuming you use Cargo to create a new program and build it in Debug mode in the standard way: cargo new myprog cd myprog cargo build You can start debugging with a simple gdbgui target/debug/myprog There are a couple of small difficulties. 1.) Instead of showing your main function the initial screen will be blank and gdbgui will print File not found: main . You need to help gdbgui out by typing main into the file browser box: and selecting the main.rs file. The source code should then appear in the browser and you can click to set breakpoints and run the program. Of course, if you want to break in some other file, you can find that in the file browser instead. Rust on macOS When you load your rust binary on a mac, you may see many warnings like this warning /Users/user/examples/rust/target/debug/deps/hello-486956f9dde465e5.9elsx31vb4it187.rcgu.o': can't open to read symbols: No such file or directory. Symbols are names of variables, functions and types defined in your program. You can define symbols for your program by loading symbol files. gdb usually does this automatically for you, but sometimes has trouble finding the right paths. In this case, you need to manually tell gdb where the symbol files is; it's usually the first part of the missing file. In the above example, it's hello-486956f9dde465e5.9elsx31vb4it187.rcgu.o . You can load this into gdb with the following command (changed as appropriate): symbol-file /Users/user/git/gdbgui/examples/rust/target/debug/deps/hello-486956f9dde465e5 2.) The GDB pretty-printing macros that Rust ships with. GDB can't find these by default, which makes it print the message warning: Missing auto-load script at offset 0 in section .debug_gdb_scripts of file /home/phil/temp/myprog/target/debug/myprog. Use `info auto-load python-scripts [REGEXP]' to list them. You can safely ignore this, but the Rust issue describes the workarounds necessary (create a .gdbinit file and paste a few lines into the Python helper script). On Windows Rust defaults to the MSVC toolchain, and gdbgui can't debug binaries compiled that way. If you want to use gdbgui , you'll have to switch to the GNU toolchain . If you want to debug programs compiled in Release mode, you will need to create a profile.release section in your Cargo.toml and add debug = true to it. See the Cargo manifest for details. and now gdb will be able to see which files were used to compile your binary, among other things. Connecting to gdbserver Like gdb, gdbserver is also made by gnu, but with the following important differences: it is much smaller than gdb it is easier to port to other architectures than all of gdb gdbserver runs on a remote machine or embedded target, which, as the name suggests, runs a server. gdb communicates with gdbserver so you can debug on your local machine. To do this, the remote machine must run the server and program: gdbserver 0.0.0.0:9000 mybinary.a Then you can launch gdb or gdbgui and connect to it. In gdbgui , use the dropdown to select Connect to gdbserver , and enter <remote ip address>:9000 Read more at the gdbserver homepage . If the machine gdbgui is running on and the target being debugged have different architectures, make sure gdb is built properly. See [] Remote Debugging Between Different Architectures For example, this is useful if you are working from an x86_64 based PC gdb client with gdbgui, to ARM arch gdbserver. You need to build the gdb client with the --host and --target flags. You need to build the gdbserver for the correct architecture. Build the gdb client that gdbgui will use.

Method 1: Using pipx (recommended) gdbgui recommends using pipx , a program to run Python CLI binaries in isolated environments. You can install pipx like this: python3 -m pip install --user pipx python3 -m userpath append ~/.local/bin Then install gdbgui with pipx: pipx install gdbgui To upgrade run pipx upgrade gdbgui When installation is finished, type gdbgui from the command line to run it, or gdbgui -h for help. To uninstall, run pipx uninstall gdbgui Try Without Installing By using pipx , you can run Python CLI programs in ephemeral one-time virtual environments. pipx run gdbgui A new tab running the latest version of gdbgui will open in your browser. Press CTRL+C to end the process, and your system will remain untouched. Method 2: Using pip pip is a popular installer for Python packages. gdbgui is a Python package and as such can be installed with pip, though we recommend using pipx rather than pip if possible. If you prefer to use Virtual Environments, you can activate one and then run pip install gdbgui You can get upgrades with pip install --upgrade gdbgui To uninstall, run pip uninstall gdbgui Method 3: Download and Run Binary Executable Download and run the binary executable for your system from https://github.com/cs01/gdbgui/tree/master/downloads . Note These binaries may not always have the latest version of gdbgui available since their builds are not automatic. The latest version will always be available on PyPI. System Dependencies for Python Package Note that this only applies if you are installing the Python package, and not using the binary executable. gdb (gnu debugger) Python 3.4+ (recommended) or 2.7 pip version 8 or higher Linux Dependencies sudo apt-get install gdb python3 macOS Dependencies brew install python3 brew install gdb --with-python --with-all-targets macOS users must also codesign gdb: follow these instructions . This will fix the error please check gdb is codesigned - see taskgated(8) . Windows Dependencies Python 3 gdb, make, gcc If you do not have already have gdb/make/gcc installed, there are two options to install them on Windows: MinGW and cygwin . MinGW (recommended) Minimal GNU for Windows ( MinGW ) is the recommended Windows option. Install MinGW with the \"MinGW Base System\" package. This is the default package which contains make , gcc , and gdb . It will install to somewhere like C:\\MinGW\\bin\\... . For example C:\\MinGW\\bin\\gdb.exe , C:\\MinGW\\bin\\mingw32-make.exe , etc. Ensure this MinGW binary directory (i.e. C:\\MinGW\\bin\\ ) is on your \"Path\" environment variable: Go to Control Panel > System Properties > Environment Variables > System Variables > Path and make sure C:\\MinGW\\bin\\ is added to that list. If it is not added to your \"Path\", you will have to run gdbgui with the path explicitly called out, such as gdbgui -g C:\\MinGW\\bin\\gdb.exe . Cygwin Cygwin is a more UNIX-like compatibility layer on Windows, and gdbgui works with it as well.

If using an Intel CPU and running Linux, gdbgui also works in conjunction with rr to let you debug in reverse. Stack/Threads View all threads, the full stack on the active thread, the current frame on inactive threads. Switch between frames on the stack, or threads by pointing and clicking. Send Signal to Inferior Choose from any signal your OS supports to send to the inferior. For example, to mock CTRL+C in plain gdb, you can send SIGINT to interrupt the inferior process. If the inferior process is hung for some reason, you can send SIGKILL , etc. Signals are also recognized by gdbgui , and a button is presented to let you step back into the program and inspect the program's state in case it exits unexpectedly. Source Code View source, assembly, add breakpoints. All symbols used to compile the target are listed in a dropdown above the source code viewer, and have autocompletion capabilities. There are two different color schemes: dark (monokai), and a light theme (default). With assembly. Note the bold line is the current instruction that gdb is stopped on. If the source file is not found, it will display assembly, and allow you to step through it as desired. Variables and Expressions All local variables are automatically displayed, and are clickable to explore their fields. Hover over a variable and explore it, just like in the Chrome debugger. Arbitrary expressions can be evaluated as well. These expressions persist as the program is stepped through. The base/radix can be modified as desired. Expressions record their previous values, and can be displayed in an x/y plot. Expressions can be interactively explored in a tree view. Memory Viewer All hex addresses are automatically converted to clickable links to explore memory. Length of memory is configurable. In this case 10 bytes are displayed per row. Registers View all registers. If a register was updated it is highlighted in yellow. gdb console Prints gdb output Allows you to write directly to the underlying gdb subprocess as if you were using it in the terminal Tab completion works, and displays a button to view help on gdb commands Can be used to ease into learning gdb Can be used as a fallback for commands that don't have a UI widget History can be accessed using up/down arrows authentication Authentication can be enabled when serving on a publicly accessible IP address. See gdbgui --help for instructions on how to enable authentication. Dashboard A dashboard is available to let you look at all gdb instances managed by gdbgui. You can kill them, or attach to them. More than one person can attach to a managed gdb subprocess and participate in the debugging session simultaneously. i.e. if one person steps forward, all connected users see the program step forward in real time. gdbgui at launch","title":"Screenshot Tour"},{"location":"screenshots/#stackthreads","text":"View all threads, the full stack on the active thread, the current frame on inactive threads.
